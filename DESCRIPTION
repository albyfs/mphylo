Title: Multifurcated Phylogenetic Trees
Description: A MultiFurcating version of the Neighbor-Joining method for 
    reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Multifurcated phylogenetic trees can 
    group more than two clusters when tied distances occur, and therefore they 
    do not depend on the order of the input taxa.
